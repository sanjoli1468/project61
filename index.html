       <h1> Hello My name is Sanjoli My Hobby is playing keyboard.
           <div class="line"></div>
           I like to Play classical, old songs. I love to perform in my school orchestra team  and it is also a proud moment for my parents.... i am declared as the rockstar of my class.
      i usually play it in my free time. This skill of Mine has Given me many opportunities in life.
      i have also won many awards. To play the piano fluently, it isn’t easy, specially bringing the soul to the music. So, I usually play pieces of music I like, after I listen to them.

But I’ve faced to a lot of difficulty during my practice for a song. I’ve just learn to play piano by myself, I used to take some courses of piano, but finally I finished them because I hadn’t much time to take the class. I’ve just learn piano in my spare time at home. some songs that I love to play are Zindagi mil ke bitayenge, love you zindagi, shukriya and many more.
Playing a musical instrument is a great hobby to have. i started playing the piano when i was five years old and still really enjoy it now it s a perfect. 
Music is the art of expressing ideas and emotions in significant sound forms by using the elements of rhythm, melody and harmony through voices, instruments, or both. Music plays a great role in everyone's life. ...

             <h2>  The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for rituals, such as a horn to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony.
